# Program Description
# This program allows the user to encode a line of text using a key value and a line of text. The encoding method
# is the Caesar cipher.
#
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
# Get the input for the key value
# Get the input for the phrase they want to encode
# Make the phrase lowercase
# I will translate the letters into numbers, adding the key value to the numbers, and converting them back into letters
# I can use an if statement before I convert the numbers back into letters to say if a number is over 26, we -25
